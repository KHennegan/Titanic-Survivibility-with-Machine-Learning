# Titanic-Survivibility-with-Machine-Learning
This code analyzes passenger data from the Titanic and uses machine learning to predict which passengers survived the Titanic by exploring data patterns through visualization, determining meaningful features in the dataset, utilizing data cleaning methods, and implementing k-fold cross validation to develop a working model.

This project was course work for Applied Machine Learning: Foundations by LinkedIn Learning
